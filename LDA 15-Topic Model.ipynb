      "If you've come here looking to learn more about patient health questionnaires used to assess mental and behavioral health disorders, you're in the right place. This blog provides information that helps answer the common question \"What is a patient health questionnaire?\" Well discuss one of the most common patient health questionnaires and how it's scored and then briefly touch on a popular variant of this patient mental health screener. More importantly, though, well provide an overview of why commonly used patient health questionnaires are coming up short. Well conclude the piece by sharing some of the key qualities that providers should look for when choosing a better alternative to these flawed solutions. Patient Health Questionnaire: Defining the Concept Despite sounding like a broad concept that could apply to nearly all areas of health and wellness, the term \"patient health questionnaire\" is typically associated with mental and behavioral disorders. And youll often see the concept treated as a proper noun and thus capitalized (i.e., Patient Health Questionnaire). Why is that the case? To answer this question, well need to step back for a moment and briefly discuss the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD). What is PRIME-MD? Generally speaking, PRIME-MD is intended to be a diagnostic tool for common mental disorders. More specifically, the PRIME-MD is a two-stage system comprised of a patient screener typically with around 30 yes/no questions for patients to answer and a clinician evaluation guide, both of which are intended to help improve the diagnosing of five types of mental disorders: depressive, anxiety, alcohol, eating disorders, and somatoform, pertaining to somatic symptom disorder, which occurs when an individual feels extreme, exaggerated anxiety about physical symptoms. The PRIME-MD was developed in the mid-1990s through funding from one of the largest pharmaceutical companies - one that just happens to develop and manufacture antidepressant drugs. When using the PRIME-MD screener and evaluation guide, which provided clinicians with follow-up questions to ask patients based upon their screener responses, took more time than clinicians wanted to spend on diagnosing mental disorders, the PRIME-MD as a standalone tool was largely abandoned. What is the Patient Health Questionnaire? Now that we have a general understanding of PRIME-MD, we can look more closely at the concept of the \"Patient Health Questionnaire,\" often referred to with its acronym of PHQ. The PHQ is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD screener. The three-page PHQ asks patients to speak to a number of potential mental health problems, signs, and symptoms they may be experiencing concerning the five modules (i.e., classes) of disorders noted above. While some questions ask patients to answer with a yes or no, others ask patients to assess how much and how long a problem \"bothered\" them. Once completed, a clinician is supposed to review the questionnaire, focusing on those questions with positive responses, and then apply diagnostic algorithms, which are included and abbreviated at the bottom of each of the three pages. In the late 1990s, one of the modules from the PHQ was broken out, which led to the creation of perhaps the most used mental health screening tool: the PHQ9. What is a PHQ9 and How is it Scored? What is the PHQ9? It's essentially the depression module of the longer, full PHQ. It asks patients to indicate how much they have been bothered by nine items over the previous two weeks. Those items are as follows: Little interest or pleasure in doing things Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless Trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much Feeling tired or having little energy Poor appetite or overeating Feeling bad about yourself - or that you are a failure or have let yourself or your family down Trouble concentrating on things, such as reading the newspaper or watching television Moving or speaking so slowly that other people could have noticed; or the opposite - being so fidgety or restless that you have been moving around a lot more than usual Thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way For their responses, patients can choose from: Not at all Several days More than half the days Nearly every day If a patient indicates they experienced any of the problems, they are then asked to speak to how difficult the problems made it for the patient to work, take care of home responsibilities, or get along with others. This is sometimes referred to as the 10th item of the PHQ9. How is the PHQ9 scored? Once completed, answers of \"Not at all\" are scored 0; answers of \"Several days\" are scored 1; answers of \"More than half the days\" are scored 2; and answers of \"Nearly every day\" are scored 3. Thus, the PHQ9 total score for the nine items ranges from 0 to 27. The National HIV Curriculum summarizes how clinicians should interpret the final score and the proposed treatment actions as follows: Unfortunately, as we will discuss momentarily, this mechanism for interpretation and action is inadequate for meeting patients needs. What is the PHQ2? A tool related to the PHQ9 is the PHQ2. What is the PHQ2? Sometimes described as the \"ultra-brief depression screening,\" it's simply the first two items from the PHQ9: Little interest or pleasure in doing things Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless The PHQ2 is scored the same as the PHQ9, with patients who screen positive on the PHQ2 expected to be further evaluated using the PHQ9. PHQ: The \"Problem\" Health Questionnaire As we stated at the beginning of this blog, the patient health questionnaires increasingly relied upon and often treated as the \"default screeners\" can cause more harm than good for patients and clinicians eager to help patients get the most appropriate and timely treatment. There are several reasons why, including the following: These patient health questionnaires frequently fail to provide practitioners with an accurate diagnosis. This can delay the ability for mental and behavioral health patients to receive the care and support services they need and may lead to patients receiving services and medications that make a condition worse. Tools like the PHQ9 and PHQ2 are designed to identify symptoms or a group of symptoms for few conditions. This often leads a practitioner to predetermine the potential diagnosis based upon the tool being used. A diagnosis bias at the beginning of the patient assessment process can easily lead a patient down the wrong treatment path. Patient health questionnaires, which are intended as screening tools, have become diagnosis tools and increasingly therapeutic decision-making (e.g., prescribing) tools. But when the diagnosis is wrong or does not take into consideration other critical factors, patient harm can be significant. We know that the patient health questionnaires largely in use today are coming up well short of their intended purposes when we look at the concerning state of mental healthcare today. Consider just the following statistics: Providers misdiagnose major depressive disorder 66% of the time.1 Providers misdiagnose generalized anxiety disorder 71% of the time.1 About 95% of people are not receiving appropriate screening.2 The average delay between symptom onset and treatment is 11 years for bipolar patients.3 People with depression miss an average of 27 days of work annually.4 Choosing a Better Patient Health Questionnaire Fortunately, while the tools like the PHQ, PHQ9, and PHQ2 are often viewed as the default, they are not the only option for providers. Even better news: Some of the alternatives available can help providers improve patient care while also potentially adding revenue. Here are some of the recommended criteria when evaluating  behavioral health tools: Comprehensive - To strengthen support diagnosis accuracy, the assessment solutions you use should rely upon clinical interviews that screen for multiple disorders simultaneously. Clinically validated - When researching alternative assessment solutions, look for those that have been cited in well-established publications, clinical trials, and studies. Independent - Knowing the source for the assessment and screening solutions you use is essential. There is inherently room for bias when using assessments funded by a company or organization that may have a financial interest in how the solutions dictate patient care decisions. Digital - The demand for virtual mental healthcare is rising fast. If you intend to provide services using telehealth, paper-based assessments will hinder effectiveness and efficiency. Accommodating virtual mental healthcare for patients requires digital assessment tools. Reimbursable - The available time for clinicians to spend with their patients is at a premium. Ensuring you can bill for mental healthcare services is an important consideration for the short- and long-term viability of many organizations. The right solution can help you get paid for screening, diagnostic interviews, and/or monitoring. Easy to use - Another way to maximize the time available for patients? Choose solutions that support fast completion times and help providers reach an accurate diagnosis more quickly, all without harming care quality or the patient experience.

      "By now, we hope your practice has had the opportunity to create and optimize your Google My Business (GMB) listing. Google has added some additional options for medical professionals to enhance their GMB listing even further and provide information about their COVID-19 policy. Why it is important to add a COVID-19 policy to my GMB listing? Most mental health practices have been affected by COVID-19 in some way. Your office hours might be different or you may be implementing new hygiene procedures to keep patients distanced and safe. You may now be offering telemental health visits. Perhaps you've created new classes or services to help patients cope with the stress that COVID-19 has brought upon us. By adding your practice's COVID-19 information to your GMB profile, you allow your clients to have the most up-to-date information about what to expect and how to access your services. This information is displayed in a prominent location on your GMB profile. What are my options for adding COVID-19 information to my GMB listing? As a healthcare provider, you have two primary ways to share COVID-19 information with your patients through your GMB listing. You can add a COVID-19 update post to your practice's listing. You may also add a COVID-19 info link to your listing that points people to a page on your own website where you can include detailed information about your COVID-19 policy. We recommend you do both. Below, we will dive into each option and provide instructions on how to make these updates. Option 1: Create a COVID-19 Update Post Your post can include text, photos, or videos, and will show up in the \"updates\" or \"overview\" tabs of your business profile when you're on a mobile device and in the \"from the owner\" section of your business profile when somebody is on a computer. Your post should include up-to-date information about how your practice is responding to COVID-19 and what changes might affect them. This is what a COVID-19 Post will look like on your GMB listing: Example of a published COVID-19 update post Google has provided some guidelines for these posts: Make sure your post is high quality: Words are spelled correctly. Content is useful for customers. Now is not the time to get creative with automated or distracting content. Respectful: Do not use profanity or offensive language, images, or videos. Regulated products/services cannot be promoted: Offering products or services in an industry that is regulated does not prohibit you from creating a post; however, the post cannot be related to the products/services themselves. Family friendly: No sexually suggestive or explicit content allowed. More suggestions and policies about what you can/can't post can be found here. It's fairly straightforward to create a COVID-19 post on your GMB listing. Sign into Google My Business. From the menu, click 'Posts' Choose the 'COVID-19 Update' tab Preview your post and either click 'back' to make edits or click 'publish' if you are happy with it How to add a COVID-19 Update Post to your Mental Health Practice's GMB listing Option 2: Add a COVID-19 Info Link to your listing As a mental healthcare provider, you are given the option to add a COVID-19 info link to your GMB listing. This gives you the ability to provide even more details about your practice's operations during the pandemic. It's important to note that this link will only show up on mobile devices (not desktop). Here's how the info link will appear on your listing: Example of what a COVID-19 Info Link will look like when published to your GMB listing To add a COVID-19 info link, you will follow the same instructions you used to add a Virtual Care link to your GMB listing. However, this time, you will simply update the COVID-19 Info link. Add a link to your mental health practice's COVID-19 Policy in your GMB settings. What information should I include in my COVID-19 information? In order to add a COVID-19 info link to your practice's GMB listing, you will need to have an appropriate page to link to. With that in mind, the first step is to create a designated page on your website to house your practice's COVID-19 information. That is the page you will link to in your GMB listing. You should consider including the following information on this page: \"Accepting new clients\". Many clients may be seeking mental healthcare for the first time and may be unsure about how to request care. Include information about how to become a new client (phone number, link to book an appointment online, etc.). Information about your current COVID-19 procedures, including any steps your practice is taking to minimize risk to patients and staff. Office hours - especially if they have changed as a result of COVID-19. Telehealth availability and how to request a telemental health appointment. New classes or services your practice is offering to help support clients during the pandemic. Other COVID-19 resources that your patients might benefit from. This could include links to third-party resources for coping with stress, anxiety, PTSD, OCD, and other disorders heightened by COVID-10. Here is a good example to inspire your own COVID-19 resource page.  Where else should I post my mental health practice's COVID-19 policy? After you've updated your GMB listing, you should also consider other places where it might be beneficial to provide your COVID-19 policy. Add a link to your COVID-19 information in a prominent location on your own website. Add a link to your Facebook page. Include a link from your Patient Portal. Print it out and post it in a visible location within your practice. Consider proactively sending it to your clients and referrers via email.  Additional COVID-19 Resources for Mental Health Providers If all of this is new to you, you're not alone. COVID-19 has created some significant and unexpected challenges for mental health practices. Check out these additional resources to help your practice adapt in these uncertain times: How to Add a Virtual Care link to your GMB Listing How to Get More Clients for your Private Practice Convert your Mental Health Private Practice to Telehealth in 5 Days or Less SBA Disaster Loans for Mental Health Practices Billing for Telehealth Amidst COVID-19 COVID-19 has been especially difficult for behavioral health practices that are still using paper to document visits and manage their business. Now might be a great time to consider switching to an EHR platform that will allow you to operate more efficiently and provide measurable positive outcomes for your patients, not only during the pandemic, but for the foreseeable future. Whether you are a prescriber, non-prescriber, or group practice, Valant's EHR and practice management software can help. \n",

      "Jennifer Ayers, BAISD supervisor of special education and 31n coordinator When students in the Bay-Arenac Intermediate School District (BAISD) returned to in-person classes in late August, Jennifer Ayers, BAISD supervisor of special education and 31n coordinator, along with Michelle Goaley, BAISD director of instructional services, and their counselors, administrators, and teachers spent the summer getting prepared to deploy the bhworks software system. The web-based platform from mdlogix has been offered to all 56 ISDs by the Michigan Department of Education to reduce youth suicides and to identify and address a range of mental health issues. \"Our 31n counselors 'played in the sandbox;' practiced on the software so they were ready once we started using the system for real when the students returned,\" Jennifer explained. \"They were set up with assessments-which we did before on paper and pencil or through Google Docs?referrals, case notes, documentation, and Medicaid billing integration. It was a complete shift, but we launched it in late August.'\" Up until this year BAISD only had two counselors for five school buildings. The District now has seven counselors to serve 13 different K-12 schools. In its entirety, BAISD encompasses seven local K-12 school districts (46 schools and approximately 14,900 students), all public, charter, parochial, and private schools. It is located in Bay City near the base of the Saginaw Bay on Lake Huron; in between the thumb and first index finger in the 'mitten' shape that is the lower part of Michigan. Michelle Goaley, BAISD Director of Instructional Services Jennifer and the 31n counselors spent a half day in August with their participating schools defining the role of the 31n counselor, and the support services they would be providing. Each school spent time 'Resource Mapping.' This enabled teams to articulate the programs, people, services and resources that currently exist in their school. It allowed schools to define and gain a better understanding of when and how they would utilize the 31n counselor. Michelle said, \"We identified each school's community support services. Schools defined what staff would have access to bhworks, and who would be responsible for completing the referral.\" Jennifer then visited each building individually to reinforce the process. \"We are trying to keep each counselor's caseload to around 40-45 students. Once we get some data from bhworks, it will guide us for placing future resources,\" Jennifer added. BAISD has entered into a technical assistance agreement with Michigan Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MiMTSS). They are training all social workers and 31n counselors on foundational Functional Behavior Assessment-Behavior Intervention Plan (FBA/BIP) processes. This will allow these staff to become FBA/BIP trainers, who will in turn provide annual training for the ISD and districts. They are working to build the capacity and skill set of their 31n counselors, as they expect there to be more students with mental health needs in the upcoming year. Each 31n counselor has developed a Mental Health Support flyer which includes a QR code that can be scanned by students or families to reach out and request support from the counselor. Students and parents at the middle school and high school level have access to the flyer in order to reach out themselves. At the elementary level, parents have access. Michelle explained, \"We want to make sure we recognize the needs of students. We want them to have the ability to reach out to ask for help in a variety of ways.\" Because the District adheres to the child study process, an intervention program that helps students who are struggling academically and/or behaviorally, and in which parents are fully involved, gaining parental consent has not been an issue. However, Jennifer is focused on the potential challenge of obtaining consent when it's a crisis situation. At times, parents do not clearly understand the support being offered, or are in denial of the support needed. Jennifer is glad they started preparing over the summer. \"When the students returned, our schools were ready to go. They understood what the process was and how to do it. For other ISDs, my advice is that the referral process should be laid out in advance, when a student should be referred, and of course it should go through the child study process,\" she said. Michelle concluded that over time, this work has expanded greatly. \"As the district increased from two to seven counselors, the need for Jennifer's role became more evident for managing the structure and systems for this to be successful. The process and system has to be strong and it has to have someone overseeing it. That's Jennifer's role. She coordinates and leads the behavioral health programs within each building in an effort to create and implement sustainable and impactful systems to support teaching and learning,\" Michelle explained. Last year, Jennifer coordinated the 31n services for five schools, but with her expanded role and the bhworks software platform, she is optimistic about where the ISD and the support provided to local districts is headed. \"We are moving forward in a way that will benefit our students,\" Jennifer said. \"Unfortunately, we don't touch the needs yet of the whole ISD, but we will get there.\" \n",

      "Schizophrenia is a cognitive and behavioral disorder characterized by the presence of a wide range of psychotic symptoms which can be classified as positive or negative [1]. Positive symptoms reflect an excess or distortion of normal functions whereas negative symptoms diminish the normal functions of the patient in relation with his motivation and interest [2]. Moreover, evidence has shown that negative symptoms are strong predictors of poor outcomes in schizophrenia [3].Although there are more specific definitions to classify predominantly negative symptoms in the literature, there is currently no consensus on the definition [4]. Currently, the evaluation of negative symptoms is done using standardized assessment tools such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) [5], the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) [6] and the Negative Symptom Assessment-16 (NSA-16). Of these, the PANSS is widely considered as the gold standard [7], however, the main disadvantage of these tools is that they are too complex and time-consuming to complete, hence making them difficult to use in standard clinical practice [8]. For this reason, the presence of systematic measures for negative symptoms in electronic health records (EHRs) is limited to nonexistent.To overcome this, at Holmusk we have developed an advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm that transforms semi-structured free text summaries of mental state evaluations (MSE) into quantitative values that can be used to measure and evaluate a patient's mental state at a determined time point [9]. Considering that we have the biggest real-world behavioral health database encompassing more that 920,000+ patients and 75+ million rows of data (including millions of drugs and diagnostic data), the possibilities are endless. From developing clinical studies to compare the effectiveness of a drug with real patients, to developing machine learning models to assess the risk of a patient developing certain symptoms, there are many ways to develop real-world behavioral health impact.In this article, we will showcase how we can use NeuroBlu to compare the effectiveness of two drugs in patients with schizophrenia. For this, we will evaluate the clinical global impression scale severity (CGI-S) and specific negative symptoms captured from the MSE with Holmusk's proprietary NLP algorithm. To achieve this, we will perform the following steps on NeuroBlu:1. Build the study cohort2. Create a category mapper project with Schizophrenia ICD codes3. Define the MSE symptoms to be analyzed4. Define the composite score that will be used to evaluate the MSE symptoms5. Run the configurable script code Build the study cohort First, we will select adult patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. NeuroBlu has a user-friendly graphical interface that allows using inclusion and exclusion criteria to create the study cohort: Create a category mapper project with Schizophrenia ICD codes In NeuroBlu, disorders are stored using ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes. We provide a graphical user interface called Category Mapper that helps build and group values (e.g. ICD diagnosis codes) to create custom categories. Category Mapper includes template projects that can be duplicated, after which they will appear in the user's project list and will be ready for use. For this article, we will duplicate the Example Diagnosis Mappings' template which includes the most common psychiatric disorders:Define the MSE symptoms to be analyzed NeuroBlu stores the NLP processed MSE data as 241 structured labels which represent the presence of various symptoms, with values indicating the severity of these symptoms. Examples illustrated below: NeuroBlu also stores a condensed version of the MSE structured labels - called RSAV - that includes only 81 labels. In this version, we can find 68 labels with possible values of 0 (if the symptom is normal / not present) or 1 (if the symptom is present).In addition, we have 13 labels with a range of values that represent the severity of the symptoms. For example, the symptom contains the following possible values: -2 (labile), -1 (blunted/constricted), 0 (reactive), 1 (intense) and 2 (flooded).The configurable script that we will use in the following sections allows us to choose the categories of labels we are going to analyze. For this project, we will use labels that are related to negative symptoms: delusion, mood, hallucination, attention/concentration, affect, suicidality, insight, general and executive functioning.Define the composite score that will be used to evaluate the MSE symptoms It is important to define how we are going to analyze the MSE symptoms as there is currently no consensus in literatures on the methodology to analyze this type of data. For this specific study, we are interested in summarizing the presence (or absence) of specific labels or symptoms using a composite score. This score will allow us to evaluate whether there is a greater or lesser presence of negative symptoms for a given patient.We will define the composite score at an specific time point with the following formula:and the formula for the normalized values would be:Let us use an example to illustrate how this score is calculated. Suppose we have a patient with different symptoms at two time points (indicated in the table below). Calculation of the sum of the symptoms values would be:Next, calculation of the normalized values would be:Thus, for this specific patient, the composite score at 60 days would be:At 180 days, the composite score would be:As we can see, this composite score allows us to summarize the presence of negative symptoms that a patient experiences at a specified time point. It's important to mention that in the following section, we will be using the terminology proxy score' instead of composite score'.Run the configurable script code In NeuroBlu, we provide our users with configurable and commented scripts in both Python and R languages, so that users only have to change certain parameters before running the code to obtain the desired analysis. In this case, we need to change the following parameters before running the code:cohort_name: The name of the cohort that we built in the first section of this article.diagnosis_category_mapper: The name of the diagnosis category mapper that we built in the second section of this article.drug_name_1 and drug_name_2: The names of the drugs to be compared. In this article we will use chlorpromazine and fluphenazine.period_days_study: The period of study in days. We will calculate the proxy score at the start and at the end of the study.After changing these parameters, we will run the code and visualize the results:The first result that will appear is a descriptive table which contains values for the selected symptom labels, as well as demographics for both cohorts:The second result will be a table containing the mean proxy score for both cohorts at two timepoints: at the start of the study and at the end of the study. In this exploratory analysis, we observe that at the end of the study, patients prescribed with fluphenazine tend to have a greater presence of negative symptoms compared to patients treated with chlorpromazine.Finally, we provide the function plot Patient History() which can be used to create a plot showing the change in the proxy score during the study period for a specific patient. By default, the script plots the first five patients in both cohorts: Conclusion In this article, we have shown how to assess the presence of negative symptoms in a cohort of patients to evaluate the effectiveness of two drugs. While this is an exploratory analysis, it showcases the potential that NeuroBlu and our proprietary NLP algorithm have for developing high-impact and novel studies using the biggest real-world behavioral health database. \n",

      "Mental health billing can feel like a gauntlet. Between navigating differing guidelines from different payers, keeping track of aging claims, appealing denials, and collecting payment from clients, it's easy to fall behind or get discouraged. Luckily, there are steps you can take to up the odds of timely payment on more claims. This makes your cash flow more predictable and, hopefully, increases overall revenue for your practice. Keep these three best practices in mind in order to collect more payments, faster. 1. Accurately capture patient demographics The number one step any behavioral health practice can take to ensure timely payment of claims is to submit clean claims. Clean claims are complete, error-free, and accurate. Mistakes such as typos, spelling errors, and missing information are frequent culprits in rejected claims, and you'll save loads of time by catching them before claims are sent. This means you should carefully collect and double-check demographics information from each patient on their first visit. At minimum, you need the following from your clients: Full legal name Birthdate Current address Gender Subscriber ID (including the Alpha Prefix) A good EHR designed for behavioral health will help you capture this and other billing-related information during the intake process. In addition, you should also examine the demographics of your overall patient population to see how it affects your payment rate. For example, seeing a certain number of clients who participate in Medicare Part B could make you eligible to participate in the Merit-based Incentive Payment System. This could net you a bonus in payments or, if you're required to participate but don't, could actually decrease the amount you earn from Medicare Part B. Examples like this help to illustrate how good reporting features within your EHR can give you a bird's-eye view of your patient population and opportunities for increased revenue. 2. Check eligibility before you see the patient You and your patient should know up front exactly what is and isn't covered by their insurance. It is much easier to collect payment from clients up front than after they have walked out your door. You'll need a tech solution that supports easy eligibility checking. Several EHRs offers electronic eligibility checking and batch eligibility checking with the click of a button. Otherwise, you'll need to contact each patient's insurance company individually, either through an online portal for eligibility checks, or by calling the provider number on the back of the insurance card. Your clearinghouse might also provide eligibility checking, although it may not be as detailed as you need in some cases. For uninsured or self-pay clients, you must provide good-faith billing estimates before any treatment as per the No Surprises Act. This is another tool to ensure that patients know the cost of your services and are willing to pay it. Remember that a patient's insurance coverage can change at any time. Patients may lose coverage, switch plans, or change carriers. For this reason, it's advisable to double-check coverage before every appointment. If you have front desk staff, make sure they understand the importance of this step, including asking about secondary insurance coverage. Finally, check for prior authorization requirements. This can help you obtain the authorization you need for certain services and prevent surprise coverage denials later. 3. Set up successful workflows at your practice To get paid as much and as often as possible, you need operational procedures that set you up for success. Here are some processes to consider: You or your staff should have step-by-step intake procedures to gather insurance information, conduct eligibility checking, and collect any copay or payments for un-covered services. You should use a template to quickly produce good-faith cost estimates to self-pay or uninsured patients. Ask clients to let you put their credit card on file; that way, you can bill for no-shows if needed. Establish a regular schedule for submitting claims. Prompt submission ensures that you don't accidentally run out the clock on an insurance company's payment window. Establish frequent checks on aging, rejected, and denied claims. It takes time to fix mistakes and negotiate with insurance, so you want to start the process early if a claim doesn't go through. This means tracking them, either through a payer or clearinghouse online portal or through your own billing software. Even if you offload billing to a third party, they should still give you regular status reports on the progress of claims. If you work at a practice with multiple staff members, decide who will perform these tasks. Who will monitor claims and follow up on denials and rejections? Make sure you and your providers are up-to-date on CPT code best practices. Incorrect coding is another major contributor to rejected claims. More importantly, adept coding can help you get the full reimbursement you deserve for every aspect of your services. A good EHR makes it easier An EHR that includes billing features and is built for behavioral health will help you and your staff implement these strategies without breaking a sweat. \n",

      "Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) involves using specific medications to help substance use patients better manage their withdrawal symptoms during recovery. This technique is often used to treat substance use disorder-and specifically opioid addiction. According to a 2016 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine, MAT can improve the health of patients and positively influence their participation in rehabilitation programs because the medication helps them to integrate their new behavioral health patterns. Although treating substance use problems with other substances (medication) may seem unconventional and counter-productive, the American Medical Association (AMA) recommends this as an effective treatment method. Commonly Used Medications for MAT There are three common medications used as part of MAT. Each is prescribed based on the patient's needs and can help the patient transition off of prescription opioids and illicit opioid substances.  Methadone is a long-acting full opioid agonist prescribed to substance use disorder patients to reduce opioid cravings and reduce withdrawal symptoms. Buprenorphine/naloxone (suboxone) is a partial opioid agonist prescribed to opioid use disorder patients to help them disassociate from their opioid receptors in order to minimize cravings. Naltrexone is prescribed to patients who have already abstained from opioids for at least a week and helps to eliminate the \"high\" associated with taking opioids in order to prevent relapses.  In most cases, MAT is combined with some form of behavioral health treatment such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or group therapy. This offers patients a comprehensive treatment plan that strengthens their overall results. How MAT Improves Recovery Outcomes Opioid withdrawals tend to be intense and severe; they can be completely debilitating to the person going through the withdrawal. The physical symptoms combined with cravings make it extremely difficult for people to recover from opioids. That's what makes MAT such an effective treatment. The prescribed medication helps to minimize cravings and reduce the intensity of withdrawal symptoms. As a result, people are less likely to relapse as a means to stop the withdrawal symptoms. This allows the patient a chance to resume their normal daily activity and gives the brain and body the time and space it needs to heal from addiction. Misconceptions about MAT The most common misconception about MAT is that one addiction is simply being replaced by another. However, MAT actually helps people to wean off of their dependence on other substances in a controlled manner over time. When the correct medication is prescribed at the proper dose by a trained professional, there are no adverse effects. This medication doesn't offer a substitute high, but rather eliminates a person's need to use substances to feel high. Another misconception about MAT is that it only delays or disrupts the recovery process. The truth is, it allows a person to recover faster than they would without any treatment. By eliminating intense cravings and removing the fear and discomfort associated with withdrawal, a person can find stability and resume their life a lot faster. Since recovery is defined as an ability to function normally, and responsibly re-enter society without the use of substances, MAT can actually enhance the recovery process. Withdrawal is the first obstacle on the road to recovery. Although treatment such as CBT can be helpful for discovering the root cause of the addiction, they are not as successful in helping people overcome the withdrawal phase. The excruciating pain and relentless cravings are what cause most people to relapse. By eliminating this through medication, it becomes significantly easier for people to abstain and truly recover. Using EHR Technology for MAT Prescription To ensure that MAT is beneficial to patients, it needs to be managed efficiently. Consequently, medical professionals at mental health facilities and rehab centers should make use of EHR technology to track and manage the process of prescribing and dispensing these medications. With integrated methadone or suboxone dispensing modules, this technology can facilitate fast approvals, seamless interactions between medical professions and the dispensing clinic. Similarly, an Electronic Medication Administration Record (eMAR) system simplifies the process of maintaining complicated medication schedules both at residential facilities and detox centers. Finally, the medication modules of EHR technology allow doctors to ePrescribe medication to their patients. An ePrescribing system makes it easy for the prescriber to access all pertinent information about a patient, order refill requests, and approve or deny prescription requests.There may be some controversy surrounding the use of MAT when it comes to substance use disorders. However, the overwhelmingly positive effects of this treatment for those suffering from opioid addiction cannot be denied. By using EHR technology, mental health professionals can ensure that essential medication is prescribed and dispensed in a controlled manner to benefit the lives of those who need it most. \n",

      "or even therapist if no improvement is noted after three sessions. Reliable change: Treatment is progressing as expected. Therapists are advised to reinforce changes and to continue treatment until progress begins to plateau, whereupon a therapist should consider reducing the frequency of sessions. Clinically significant change: The client is likely no longer struggling with issues that led to therapy. Therapists are advised to consolidate changes, anticipate potential setbacks, and consider reducing the frequency of sessions. Trainees in the no-feedback condition at the marriage and family clinic administered the Outcome Rating Scale at the beginning of each session (to track outcome) but did not observe, score, or discuss the results with clients. The measures were placed in a centralized collection area and were scored by a co investigator. To reduce the potential for demand characteristics (i.e., concern that people would not answer honestly for fear of hurting the trainee's feelings or grade), trainees in both groups were instructed to encourage clients to complete the measures honestly and to tell clients that their scores would not be tied to the trainee's grade or evaluation. Trainees in the no-feedback condition in the clinical- counseling program did not have clients complete the measures and provided services in a business-asusual format. All supervisees received weekly individual and group supervision (trainees were not separated by treatment condition for group supervision). Individual supervision typically consisted of providing updates on a supervisee's caseload and viewing selected video and audio recordings of a session for discussion. More focus was placed on the supervisee's goals and strengths or weaknesses in the individual supervision format. Group supervision typically relied on a case presentation format with supervisees designated to present on clients with a selected video or audio recording segment to facilitate the presentation. Time was also provided to discuss pressing trainee concerns regarding clients and other trainee needs. The client feedback group used PCOMS in both individual and group supervision to facilitate the aforementioned supervision formats. For the feedback group in individual supervision, supervisors and supervisees reviewed each client's scores together using the PCOMS categories to denote whether a client was progressing as expected and, if not, identified strategies for how to proceed. In general, the data were used to help direct which clients needed more attention in supervision. Supervisors used the client feedback data to organize the supervisory sessions in a triage fashion, prioritizing those clients demonstrating less progress (i.e., deteriorating or no change) or having lower scores. Clients identified as progressing as expected (i.e., reliable change or clinically significant change) or having higher scores were discussed later within the supervisory session to identify or reinforce the trainee's areas of strength. In group supervision, the PCOMS data were used similarly, but trainees in the feedback condition (rather than both supervisor and trainee) selected which client(s) needed the most attention. Both Outcome Rating Scale and SRS scores were used to provide more information about the client to be discussed. Trainees in the nofeedback condition received individual and group supervision as usually provided. The time spent in individual and group supervision was equal for both conditions. Trainees in both conditions completed the counselor selfefficacy measure (i.e., COSE) at the beginning and end of the fall semester and again at the end of the spring semester. The SOS and the SWAI-T were completed by trainees in both conditions at the middle and end of the fall semester and again at the end of the spring semester to evaluate their perceptions of their supervisory experience. Supervisors were not permitted to review the results of these measures. Results Did Outcomes Improve Over the Course of an Academic Year? Pre-post means for the feedback and no-feedback conditions for trainees in the marriage and family program help provide a context for the use of PCOMS with trainees. Trainees in the feedback group demonstrated better outcomes with clients than did trainees in the no-feedback group. Clients in the feedback group had a mean gain of 8.90 points from pretest to posttest (range  19.25 to 28.15), whereas clients in the control group had a mean gain of 4.01 points (range  18.56 to 22.56). These findings are consistent with research in which professional staff have used PCOMS (see Miller, Duncan, Sorrell, & Brown, 2005). Pretest score differences for both groups were not statistically significant. A repeated measures factorial analysis of variance, using supervisor as a covariate, found that trainees in both groups demonstrated statistically significant improvement overall with clients, F(1, 92)  47.76, p  .000,  2  .34. Clients in the feedback condition showed better outcomes than did those in the no-feedback condition (Time  Condition), F(1, 92)  6.88, p  .05,  2  .07. The eta-square of .07 is considered to be a small to medium effect size (Cohen, 1988). The supervisor covariate was not statistically significant, F(1, 92)  0.11, p  .05,  2  .00. To look at individual trainee effectiveness, we computed effect sizes for each client who completed treatment. Cohen's d was computed by using the highest original standard deviation for each group mean rather than using a pooled standard deviation to avoid inflating the effect size common with measures (Dunlap, Cortina, Vaslow, & Burke, 1996). A mean treatment outcome effect size for each trainee was computed by aggregating the outcome effect size for each client in the trainee's caseload. Trainees in the feedback condition had a mean effect size of 0.92 (range  0.43 to 1.72) versus a mean of 0.23 (range  _x0007_ 0.22 to 1.02) for trainees in the no-feedback condition. However, we found no statistically significant differences in the mean number of sessions attended by clients in each condition (feedback  5.40, no-feedback  4.19), t(113)  1.42, p  .05. To assess whether supervisees progressed during their training, we compared their effectiveness with clients across academic semesters. Specifically, we examined whether trainees in the feedback condition demonstrated more improvement (as evidenced by client outcomes) during the academic year as compared with trainees in the no-feedback condition. Trainees in both the feedback and the no-feedback conditions evidenced improvement from the first to the second semester as shown by aggregated effect sizes (see Figure 1). The feedback group demonstrated an effect size Scores on the SWAI-T and SOS indicated that trainees' perceptions of the supervisory relationship and satisfaction with supervision were similar for the no-feedback group across the academic year but more variable for the feedback group (see Table 1). However, a repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance revealed no differences between the groups, Wilks's   .03, F(2, 12)  0.15, p  .05,  2  .03. The interaction (Time  Condition) also indicated no statistically significant differences. It appears that contrary to our hypothesis, using the continuous assessment system in supervision did not influence the supervisory alliance or overall satisfaction with supervision. To investigate whether the supervisory alliance or satisfaction with supervision was related to trainee effectiveness as measured by client outcome, we examined correlations between the SWAI-T, the SOS, and the mean treatment outcome effect size for each trainee. Correlations between the SWAI-T and the SOS were .82 (middle of fall), .83 (end of fall), and .92 (end of spring). These strong correlations are consistent with previous research investigating the supervisory alliance and satisfaction with supervision (Ladany et al., 1999). Correlations between these variables and trainee effect sizes were much lower, ranging from .05 to .24 (see Table 2). A correlation of .23 was observed between outcome and the therapeutic alliance as measured by the SRS at Session 3. It is also worth noting that the correlation between the SWAI-T and SRS (r  .89) at the end of the academic year was statistically significant. These results indicate that as expected, the quality of the supervisory alliance was related to the quality of the therapeutic alliance. Did PCOMS Influence Counselor Self-Efficacy? As can be seen in Table 3, the COSE scores for trainees in both conditions increased across the academic year. A repeated measures analysis of variance found the differences across time to be statistically significant within each group, F(2, 12)  4.50, p  .05,  2  .56. However, the interaction effect (Time  Condition) showed that the degree of change between the groups was not different, F(2, 12)  0.13, p  .05,  2  .04. Contrary to our expectations, trainees who used PCOMS data in supervision did not report larger increases in counseling self-efficacy when compared with trainees who did not use PCOMS. A secondary hypothesis was to investigate the relationship between counselor self-efficacy and client outcome. Although the correlations between the COSE and outcome increased over time, all of the correlations were low (see Table 2), with coefficients ranging from .02 (beginning of the year) to .19 (end of the year). With few exceptions, COSE scores did not correlate highly with measures of satisfaction with supervision or the supervisory alliance. We also conducted the same correlational analyses for each condition (see Table 4). The correlations between counseling selfefficacy and outcome were surprisingly different for each condition; at the end of training, the self-efficacy scores reported by trainees in the feedback condition were strongly related to their aggregate therapy outcome (i.e., effectiveness) effect sizes  Discussion Few psychotherapy supervision studies have investigated whether and how client outcome might inform psychotherapy training and supervision. Using outcome data that are collected from clients every session has been proffered as a way to help redress this limitation. Such continuous assessments offer other potential advantages as well. Monitoring client feedback could help provide rich information for use in supervision by enabling supervisors to monitor supervisee progress more closely (Lambert & Hawkins, 2001). The purpose of this study was to investigate the promise of using continuous outcome data in supervision and the manner in which these data influence the supervisory process. Results indicated that although most trainees experience positive outcomes with their clients and supervisors, trainees who used a continuous assessment system (i.e., PCOMS) with clients and shared the feedback data in supervision demonstrated better outcomes with their caseloads than did trainees in a control group who did not use continuous assessment. The treatment gain scores for trainees in the continuous feedback condition (8.90) versus those in the no-feedback condition (4.01) and the number of clients who demonstrated clinically significant improvement in each group (28% vs. 15%) indicates that trainees who received continuous feedback from their clients were approximately twice as effective as those who did not receive feedback over the course of therapy. This is consistent with previous research (Miller et al., 2005) and indicates that the usefulness of the Outcome Rating Scale and SRS extends to master's-level psychotherapy trainees. Trainee Improvement Few supervision studies have directly examined the relationship between client outcome and the quality of training. Successful outcome in supervision has typically been operationalized from the supervisee's perspective. However, the overarching goal of supervision is to improve one's counseling skills, thereby increasing one's ability to help clients. The current study demonstrated that irrespective of group, trainees were generally helpful to their clients (average Cohen's d  0.56). Client outcomes improved throughout treatment regardless of the trainee's group assignment. However, trainees in the feedback group had better outcomes in the first semester and demonstrated even more improvement in the second semester than did those in the no-feedback group. Comparing the client psychotherapy outcomes of trainees is fraught with threats to internal validity given that each supervisee's caseload consists of clients from diverse backgrounds who differ in any number of ways, including presenting problem and level of problem severity. Therefore, conclusions from this study about how to improve supervision training and therapy outcomes should be interpreted with caution. Ronnestad and Ladany (2006) noted that \"there are significant obstacles to gathering data in a controlled fashion on the relationship between supervision process and outcome and psychotherapy process and outcome\" (p. 263). However, having a better gauge of how trainees perform with their clients is one way to track trainees' progress and serves as a means of ensuring that trainees are capable of demonstrating a minimum level of competence. Direct outcome comparisons could be misleading but may also be meaningful if made in an ipsative fashion. Supervisory Alliance and Satisfaction With Supervision Although trainees who used PCOMS in supervision demonstrated better client outcomes, they did not report a better supervisory alliance or more satisfaction with supervision than those who did not use the feedback system. The results were surprising given the expectation that the use of outcome data in supervision would lead to more specific feedback, which is considered a marker of effective supervision (Lehrman-Waterman & Ladany, 2001). A concern expressed by both supervisors and supervisees before the study was that the likelihood of negative feedback would increase and hurt the supervisory relationship. Perhaps this anticipation led to heightened sensitivity on the trainee's part when discussing a client who was not progressing. Another possibility is that the supervisor focused more on the data and information from the measures and less on the supervisee, which may have affected the supervisee's perception of the supervisory relationship. A more positive way of looking at the data is that the use of continuous feedback in the supervisory process did not negatively influence trainees' satisfaction with supervision or their perceptions of the supervisory alliance. When asked about the supervisory process after the study, supervisors explained that using the continuous assessment data in supervision made providing critical feedback easier and served as a starting point for providing more specific feedback. Hoffman et al. (2005) found that most supervisors withhold feedback regarding performance. Our results may help quell concerns that giving such feedback will harm the supervisory relationship. Importance of the Supervisory Alliance The supervisory alliance has been conceptualized to function similarly to the therapeutic alliance in that a good working relationship is foundational to effective training. Although the literature is clear that successful supervision is predicated on a good supervisory alliance (Nelson & Friedlander, 2001), the literature is less clear on how successful supervision is defined, particularly as regards the perspectives of the other stakeholders in the therapy process. The supervision literature is also decidedly mixed on how the supervisory relationship influences training outcomes (Ladany et al., 1999). The results of this study provide evidence that the Correlations of Counseling Self-Estimate Inventory (COSE) With Trainee Outcomes by Condition supervisory alliance is related to client outcome. The correlation between the supervisory alliance and client outcome is similar to correlations typically found between the therapeutic alliance and client outcome (Baldwin, Wampold, & Imel, 2007; Martin, Garske, & Davis, 2000). However, correlations between the supervisory relationship and counselor self-efficacy were all quite low. Past evidence for this relationship is unclear; some researchers have found such a relationship (Efstation et al., 1990), and others have not (Ladany et al., 1999). Although this study provides evidence that the supervisory relationship is important, the feedback condition was small and results cannot be generalized at this time. In general, this study's data indicated that trainees were generally happy with their relationships with supervisors and the quality of supervision received as indicated by the SWAI-T mean scores. More research is clearly needed to understand the role of the supervisory alliance in promoting psychotherapy training. Counselor Self-Efficacy and Trainee Development Two questions guided our investigation of trainees' counseling self-efficacy beliefs. First, we sought to examine whether the condition to which trainees were assigned, with or without client feedback, would differentially affect trainees' efficacy beliefs. Our results indicate that trainees in both conditions experienced statistically significant gains in counseling self-efficacy across the training year. Several explanations could account for this. First, consistent with Bandura's (1997) theorizing, the practical experience all trainees obtained could have served to boost their self-efficacy. Indeed, mastery experience has been shown to be the most powerful source of self-efficacy, and in this study such experiences may have overshadowed the social persuasions that trainees in each group received. A second explanation could be that although trainees in both groups reported similar self-efficacy levels at the conclusion of the study, the self-efficacy beliefs reported by trainees in the nofeedback group were inflated. This seems plausible given the lower outcome scores for these trainees' clients. This is also consistent with past research. Researchers who asked therapists to rate their level of effectiveness found that therapists rated themselves equally, regardless of their actual level of performance (Hiatt & Hargrave, 1995). Perhaps this sort of \"Lake Wobegon effect\" was at work for those trainees who did not receive explicit feedback from their clients and who, given this missing feedback, assumed themselves to be equally capable of treating their clients despite their actual differences. Our second aim for investigating counselor self-efficacy beliefs was to test Bandura's (1997) hypothesis that self-efficacy beliefs are positively related to actual performance. Specifically, we sought to examine whether trainees who reported higher counselor self-efficacy also experienced better client outcomes throughout the year. Research in a number of disciplines has found that those who believe themselves to be capable tend to put forth more effort, persevere in the face of difficulty, and set more challenging goals for themselves (Bandura, 1997). We found that self-efficacy was related to outcome (r  .52), but only for trainees in the client feedback condition. Providing consistent feedback on performance (e.g., Locke & Latham, 2002) has been found to lead to improved performance. Comparing the correlation between client outcome and counseling self-efficacy for the feedback group to the low correlation obtained for the no-feedback group reveals that perhaps the efficacy beliefs of counselors in the feedback group was better calibrated with the clients. Those in the no-feedback condition, however, had limited information on which to base their efficacy judgments, namely their perceptions of the client's progress in therapy and the comments they received during supervision. With this in mind, it does not seem surprising that trainees who received regular feedback from clients on outcome and the therapeutic relationship had levels of self-efficacy that were more closely related to their actual performance with clients. These results nevertheless point to the complexity of counseling self-efficacy and suggest that increasing self-efficacy during training is not a panacea that automatically results in better client outcomes. This contention is supported by previous findings that outcome with career counseling clients may not have a linear relationship with counseling self-efficacy (Heppner et al., 1998). Limitations of Study There are limitations in this study that warrant mention. First, the sample of trainees and supervisors was small and consisted of only two master's programs. Tracking trainees' outcomes with their clients for an entire academic year is a strength of the study, but the generalizability of the results, particularly for doctoral training programs, is limited. The small sample size also limited the ability to conduct more powerful analyses. Hierarchical linear modeling would have been the preferred analysis to assess growth curves across the academic year for both clients and trainees and would have helped better capture individual growth, but the sample size was not adequate. A second limitation is the issue of treatment integrity. This study involved three levels of participants: clients, trainees, and supervisors, which made it difficult for us to ensure that participants complied with the study's protocol. Trainees were most enthusiastic about the project and expressed excitement that they would have an additional tool to use in therapy.  Their supervisors were generally less enthusiastic, however, about an additional responsibility in supervision. Protocol adherence was evidenced by the positive anecdotal feedback from supervisors and supervisees and that the majority of clients completed measures consistently throughout the academic year. Participant compliance was encouraged via e-mail reminders sent to the supervisors during the midpoint of each semester. Another limitation is that trainees from the marriage and family program were all placed in one setting and the clinical- counseling trainees were placed in different training sites. Although client outcomes with the clinical- counseling trainees were not used in comparing differences in outcome between treatment conditions, their placement in a variety of settings may have led to different levels of success with clients and, consequently, different experiences and perceptions of their training and supervision. However, trainees from all the programs rated their supervisory experiences and counseling self-efficacy similarly. A fourth limitation was that we used a continuous assessment system that has less empirical support than the OQ45 (Lambert et al., 1996), although initial research on PCOMS has been encouraging. The reason for using PCOMS was twofold: The study sites were resistant to using longer measures, and PCOMS provides additional information  about the therapeutic alliance that we believe was valuable feedback for trainees to receive. Last, it was not possible to know how to connect the effects of supervision directly to client outcome. Using a continuous outcome model appears to have been helpful for trainees to use with clients, but we are uncertain of its utility within the supervisory process. It is plausible that outcomes would have been equally as impressive if the client feedback data were not used in the supervisory sessions. Future Study We considered this study to be an exploratory investigation. We could not identify other studies that have assessed the utility of continuous client feedback in counselor training and supervision. Nevertheless, our findings point to several fruitful research possibilities to be pursued. First, a similar design with the addition of a third condition in which trainees use a continuous assessment model with clients but not in their supervision would help assess whether using outcome data in supervision leads to improved client outcomes. Second, studies in this area may also include using other continuous assessment measures such as the OQ45 and evaluating the utility of the different components of client feedback provided. For example, one of the reasons PCOMS was selected was to include a measure of the therapeutic relationship. How is the inclusion of this measure useful to trainees? Third, one of the proposed advantages of using continuous assessment is that it lends itself to more specific feedback in supervision. Using a measure that directly assesses this process may shed light on how using continuous assessment data contributes to the supervision process. Also, future research should continue to investigate how counselor self-efficacy and other person-level variables may mediate both supervisory and client outcomes. Although conducting supervision research that focuses on client outcome is difficult and challenging, such research is important and necessary given the centrality of supervision to counselor training. The question of whether supervisory training is beneficial is in part still unanswered because of limited research in this area (Stein & Lambert, 1995). Conclusions The main purpose of psychotherapy supervision is to help trainees become more effective clinicians. It makes sense that tracking client outcome would be helpful in this process. The results of this study demonstrated that with a sample of master's program trainees, using continuous assessment measures, the Outcome Rating Scale and SRS, resulted in better client outcomes. Trainees in both conditions demonstrated improved client outcomes over the course of an academic year, although those in the feedback condition showed twice as much improvement. An informal qualitative analysis found that trainees in the feedback condition were pleased that they could monitor how they were doing with their clients as novice therapists. They also felt that feedback from clients gave them more structure and a good place to start with new or \"difficult\" clients. Supervisors generally felt that client feedback was less useful, but they agreed that client feedback assisted them in providing trainees with challenging feedback and helped to identify clients who needed more attention in supervision. Using client feedback data in supervision did not enhance the supervisory relationship, satisfaction with supervision, or counselor self-efficacy reported by trainees when compared with reports from trainees in the no-feedback condition. Interestingly, the correlation found between the supervisory working alliance and client outcome is similar to correlations found for the therapeutic alliance and outcome. Additionally, we found moderate correlations between counseling self-efficacy and outcome for trainees who received client feedback data, whereas we found negative correlations between counseling self-efficacy and outcome for those in the no-feedback condition. For practicum sites that have limited ability to video- or audiotape consistently or for supervisors who have a large number of supervisees that makes keeping track of client caseloads cumbersome, the use of a continuous assessment model for trainees may be especially appealing. In both situations, a supervisor is often left to rely on a trainee's perceptions. We know such perceptions are not always accurate and that therapists tend to overestimate client progress (Grove et al., 2000). Trainees' ambivalence about wanting to share mistakes in the evaluative context of supervision also makes sole reliance on trainees' self-reported performance problematic. Using outcome data consistently in supervision may help therapists have a more accurate perception of their abilities and may also serve as a means of normalizing the process of sharing information about clients, particularly when things are not going well. Trainees need to know that even the best therapists are not successful with all of their clients. Conversely, seeing concrete evidence that clients are benefiting and improving from therapy can be motivating and may bolster one's sense of self-efficacy. Specific feedback is considered a key ingredient in effective supervision, and the use of client outcome in supervision holds the promise of facilitating this process. Despite this optimism, caution should be taken in how client data are used as a supervisory tool. Care should be taken to help trainees recognize that monitoring client outcome is not to reduce their counseling skills to an effect size but rather to help them gain a clearer understanding of how they work with clients and to help them become more effective as therapists. \n",

      "Pride can be a unifying force that brings people together in a positive way to achieve a goal. Pride is also a feeling that arises from self-respect. During Pride Month, the LGBTQIA+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, intersex, asexual, and other genders and identities) community honors diversity, while also advocating for equality and acceptance. Yet, many LGBTQIA+ individuals routinely face discrimination, ranging from biased public policies to subtle microaggressions to outright violence. Additionally, many individuals wrestle with their own sexual identities, resulting in deep distress. Depression, anxiety, and suicide are common behavioral health concerns. As health service providers care for LGBTQIA+ patients, they must keep behavioral health and well-being top of mind. Knowing that LGBTQIA+ individuals experience behavioral health issues at a higher rate than heterosexual and cisgender individuals (those who identify with the male or female gender assigned at birth), care providers should consider screening all LGBTQIA+ patients routinely to ensure they receive appropriate care. LGBTQIA+ and behavioral health conditions A number of factors contribute to mental well-being for LGBTQIA+ individuals, just as they do for anyone. However, the prevalence of behavioral health issues is higher for LGBTQIA+ individuals, according to research. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), published in September 2020 by SAMHSA, notes that 7.6 million LGBTQIA+ adults had a mental health condition or substance use disorder (SUD) in 2019, reflecting an increase of more than 20 percent over the previous year. About 1.9 million LGBTQIA+ adults experienced both a mental health condition and SUD, representing 12.9 percent of the population. By comparison, 3.8 percent of the general population reported both a mental health condition and SUD. Serious mental illness and major depressive episodes are on the rise for LGBTQIA+ communities, according to NSDUH. In 2019, 2.6 million LGBTQIA+ adults age 18 and older experienced serious mental illness - a significant increase from the 1.4 million reported in 2014. This figure represents more than 18 percent of the LGBTQIA+ population, compared with 5.2 percent of the general population. Tragically, the rates of suicide and suicidal ideation for the population remains high with national statistics showing these trends are also increasing. Serious thoughts of suicide LGBTQIA+ (age 18 to 25): 27.9% General Population (age 18 to 25): 11.8% LGBTQIA+ (age 26 to 49): 14.5% General Population (age 26 to 49): 5.3% Attempted suicide LGBTQIA+ (age 18 to 25): 5.5% General Population (age 18 to 25): 1.8% LGBTQIA+ (age 26 to 49): 2.2% General Population (age 26 to 49): 0.6% As the data demonstrates, suicide disproportionately impacts younger individuals. A 2020 national survey from the Trevor Group found among LGBTQIA+ individuals age 13 to 24, 40 percent seriously considered suicide in the previous 12 months, and 48 percent engaged in self-harm. What's most challenging about capturing an accurate picture of these serious behavioral health concerns is that the full range of LGBTQIA+ identities are not typically included in studies. In fact, SAMHSA didn't begin to collect information on identity or sexual orientation for its studies until 2015. In general, this means the prevalence of behavioral health conditions could be under-reported or inaccurately reported in many studies and trend lines. Factors driving behavioral health concerns Identifying as LGBTQIA+ does not by itself cause a particular risk for behavioral health conditions, but fear, rejection, discrimination, bullying, and violence commonly experienced by the population is what often increases the risk. These influences permeate everyday life. Discrimination in the workplace can result in lower income or job loss for adults. Rejection by family can make home life difficult, and bullying at school can make it hard for youth to learn or make friends. The Trevor Project survey found that 60 percent of LGBTQIA+ youth experienced discrimination. And 1 in 3 reported that they had been physically threatened or harmed in their lifetime because of their sexual orientation and/or gender identity. Something as simple as using a restroom that corresponds with their gender identity can cause discrimination for transgender and nonbinary youth. Surprisingly, even healthcare providers demonstrate bias against LGBTQIA+ individuals. The American Journal of Public Health reported in 2015 that among heterosexual providers, implicit preferences largely favor heterosexual people over lesbian and gay people. While the study didn't examine the effects related to the care these clinicians provide, it's not hard to imagine the potential for reduced care quality as well as low patient satisfaction. At the highest extreme, bias against LGBTQIA+ individuals can take the form of violence, which includes everything from pushing and shoving to fatal assaults. In fact, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Foundation - which has collected data on violent deaths since 2013 - reported that at least 37 transgender and gender non-conforming people were killed in 2020. It's the largest number of deaths HRC has reported so far. According to HRC, divisive and dehumanizing rhetoric contributes to \"the toxic mix of racism, sexism and transphobia that drives this horrific violence.\" What care providers can do As care providers strive to be more inclusive of the range of identities and the fluidity of gender, they can further refine their approaches to behavioral health concerns in the LGBTQIA+ community. Even more so, broader efforts are needed to address barriers to care for this underserved population. The Trevor Project survey reported that 84 percent of the more than 40,000 youth respondents said they wanted counseling from a mental health professional, but only 38 percent received it. Inability to afford care was the most common barrier, followed by concerns about parents' permission to obtain care and concerns about finding an LGBTQIA-competent provider. For care providers, the most important action they can take is to ask their patients how they're feeling and screen for mental health and SUD conditions. They should be open to having an honest discussion about behavioral health needs, referring to specialty care and LGBTQIA-competent providers when appropriate. Some simple actions can also help care providers support LGBTQIA+ patients. For example, clinicians should understand the terms often used to identify gender, including \"gender fluid\" and \"nonbinary.\" Providers also might ask patients which pronouns they prefer or if they want to be called by a first name other than the one on their identification or insurance card. Caring for the behavioral health needs of transgender and gender non-conforming patients helps to build more-inclusive systems of care. By doing so, providers can promote improvements in health equity and better serve their communities. \n",

      "September is recognized as Suicide Prevention Awareness Month- a time meant to raise awareness and open the dialog around suicide, while advocating for better mental health care. As part of this awareness month, September 5th-11th is recognized as National Suicide Prevention Week, and September 10th as World Suicide Prevention Day.Suicide and the Military One population that is hit particularly hard with death by suicide is the military. In 2019, the VA released its National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report, which showed that the suicide rate for veterans was 1.5 times the rate of non-veteran adults. While veterans make up just 7.9% of the adult population in the United States, they account for 13.5% of all adult deaths by suicide.In a 2018 report, Department of Veterans Affairs records show that 22 veterans and active service members lose their life to suicide every day. During the Global War on Terror (2001-2019), there were approximately 5,440 active duty members killed in action and aproximately 115,000 deaths by suicide in the same time frame. That means roughly 21 veterans ended their lives by their own hand for every one that was killed by an enemy combatant-a truly stunning and staggering number. Suggesting new ways to prioritize mental health in the military, veterans advocate Charles P. Smith offers a data-driven plan to help prevent suicide and ensure service members get proper care before, during and after active duty. In his TED Talk, \"How the US Can Address the Tragedy of Veteran Suicide\", he suggests building data sets around veteran suicide is an important step in addressing this problem. And the data gathered would not just apply to the military; the information can be used to help the general population as well. \"If we put our minds together and our resources together, and we openly talk about this, and try to find solutions for this epidemic that's going on in America, hopefully we can save a life.\" Listen to his TED Talk to learn more about suicide in the military, and recommendations for addressing this public health crisis. Addressing the Stigma Around Suicide People have become increasingly comfortable talking about their mental health, but the topic of suicide continues to have a stigma surrounding it. The stigma associated with mental health treatment, however, continues to be a major barrier to effective care for many active-duty military and veterans, because many fear consequences to their career if news of their diagnosis or treatment plan reaches their superior. By learning more about what leads someone to suicide, researching ways we can help to prevent it, and making resources available, we can empower our communities to address this leading cause of death.

      "As the UK marks National Work-Life Week (12-16 October), we have examined the issue of work-life balance in two blog posts: one looking to examine the issues and to help organisations and managers spot the signs that their colleagues may be struggling to get the balance right; and a second, which suggests some strategies, tips and ideas that could help both managers and employees to stay on the right track. We see a vital role for employers, and those who support employers on the issue of health and wellbeing, to acknowledge the significant impact that work-life balance problems can have and to help provide the support and proactive, preventative workplace culture that can help employees to thrive. Part one. Work-life balance: the problem The Welsh textile manufacturer and social reformer, Robert Owen, declared in 1810 that the ideal work-life balance would be \"eight hours labour, eight hours recreation, eight hours rest\" (1), something he tried to adopt and support at his New Lanark Mill on the banks of the River Clyde. Fast forward 200 years and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (2), declared that UK workers spend on average around 38 hours a week at work, making for a roughly seven and a half hour working day. So far, so good? In that case, why do we hear regularly about issues with work-life balance in the UK and find that a recent Mental Health Foundation survey (3) showed one third of respondents feel unhappy or very unhappy about the time they devote to work? Where is it going wrong in UK workplaces? How can you spot if your employees are struggling to get the balance between work and home right? What are the signs of trouble? Work-life balance is a relative concept and one that is personal to every manager or employee. One size does not fit all. Each person needs to establish and define what is the right balance for them and not everyone will share the same philosophy in how to approach their work or have the same pressures and responsibilities in their lives. These outside work pressures are not just about employees who have families and caring responsibilities, but those who are, for example, committed in other ways outside of work, whether with active social lives, in community roles or simply because they value having time during the day to walk their dog as it helps them to stay healthy and happy. As we unpack the issues around work-life balance, we see them fall into three main categories; boundaries, expectations and support. Boundaries It is the blurring of the lines between home and work which often causes the biggest concerns for employees, sometimes leading to a feeling that is too difficult for people to leave work at their desks, to switch off physically or mentally from emails and other messages, and hard to get a break from thinking about to-do lists, upcoming meetings or ongoing work challenges. That of course has become even more of an issue in the COVID era we are living through as so many people are having to work at home, making the physical separation between work and home even harder to achieve. In 'normal times', these boundary concerns are often highlighted by behaviours like employees engaging in regular late night and weekend working and emailing, or them being in the office long hours, often with early starts and late finishes and with lunches always being eaten at their desks. Within the working day there can too often be little time made for any breaks - even short intervals for a walk around the office, some fresh air, a coffee pitstop or a protected 30-40 minute break for lunch. Outside of the working day there is the temptation, too often accepted, to start working as soon as people wake up, reaching for their mobile device to check emails even before getting out of bed. People's commute to the office can very often be an extension of work time when emails are tackled, papers reviewed for meetings or phone calls being made - not a few minutes to read the newspaper, turn the pages of a book or to listen to music or a podcast; using the time to recharge the batteries, getting ready for the day ahead. As so often, technology is an enabler for so many positive things in society, including flexible working, allowing us to work from multiple locations - not just our offices and desks. But it can also be an enabler for not switching off and for 24/7 working or thinking. It is an 'always on' culture which has crept into many workplaces and can be contributed to by the easy availability of emails, tablets and a variety of convenient tools that make working from anywhere possible. With this powerful technology in the hands of nearly everyone in the workplace, it is more important than ever to have explicit strategies in place to ensure that employees can make sure they are not neglecting themselves, their home-lives and their health and wellbeing, at the expense of keeping one step ahead in the corporate career race and keeping on top of their inboxes and to do lists. The human stories behind the unhappiness the Mental Health Foundation uncovered in their survey will be typically those of employees feeling they were simply working too many hours, being contacted when at home and trying to unwind and then struggling to be able to clearly identity when the working day started and ended. These unclear boundaries can lead people to feel that they can never get away from their work and that it can intrude into their home life, often causing stress, anxiety and in severe cases causing or contributing to serious mental health issues. Expectations When Robert Owen pioneered the eight-hour working day in the UK, it was typical for factories, mills and other workplaces to operate 24 hours a day and for employees to be expected to work between 10-15 hour shifts, six or seven days a week. We have clearly come a long way since then but there is a second issue for managers to be alive to in the modern workplace; that of expectations and the pressures that poorly-defined or poorly-communicated expectations can have on their teams and the people they manage. Many employees now feel that, as we discussed earlier, the ability to be able to respond to emails and other work demands from the comfort of their mobile device means that people are under pressure to reply even when the email is received out of normal working hours - sometimes at weekends - and even when it is not urgent. It is so often a conversation that managers could but don't have with their teams: setting out their own approach to work and what they expect from their employees, including expectations on responses to emails. Having good quality, meaningful conversations about expectations is crucial and is so often absent from teams and line manager-employees relationship. How often does a line manager sit down with a new team member and say: \"this is how I like to work, the hours I keep, what I expect from you, what you can expect from me\" in really practical terms. Sometimes managers and those in other senior roles will work late into the evening or at weekends as that is either the nature of their role or because it works for them but they don't expect their teams to follow suit. The problem is that often they do not make that expectation clear. Support Increasingly, organisations have been putting in place formal and informal support for their employees which could help them address concerns about work-life balance. This support can include flexible working policies, initiatives which encourage employees to access subsidised exercise or wellbeing activities, such as gym memberships, yoga classes and the like, and the provision of face-to-face and online mental health support, including that provided by SilverCloud. The challenge for many employees is twofold. Firstly, they often do not know these support services are available and, secondly, employees will report they didn't think the issues they were facing were serious enough or they were not worried enough to access the support available. This is such a common issue in the workplace, where employees do not access support because they don't feel sick enough. Here, the role of the line manager and the culture of the organisation is critical. We argue that by building a culture of wellbeing in the workplace, in which support is both available and discussed openly and regularly, with leadership figures acting as role models in both discussing work-life balance issues and sharing their own approaches and some tips and ideas, can be a game changer. Employees are much more likely to engage with the issues of work-life balance and take action to make improvements in their lives, which has a positive effect on their performance, if they believe they will get the support from their employer. Conclusions and next steps Reducing the stigma of raising issues about your mental health and talking about issues related to work-life balance is critical in the workplace, but it needs to be a starting point and not the end game. Employers who invest in a culture that encourages positive, proactive and supportive discussions about boundaries and expectations - that is clear on the importance of every employee being committed to their work but equally committed to their home life and their wellbeing - encourages happier employees, reduces the costs of sickness absence due to poor mental health and drives high performance. That same Mental Health Foundation survey cited earlier says that nearly two thirds of employees have experienced a negative effect from work on their personal life, including lack of personal development, physical and mental health problems, and poor relationships and poor home life (3). There can be little doubt that we need to be having more frequent and more meaningful conversations in the workplace about work-life balance, what it means for every member of each team and how together we can support each other. Perhaps National Work-Life Week is the perfect time to start those conversations or build on ones already happening within your organisation. \n",

      "People with co-existing physical and mental health problems face many challenges when it comes to accessing health care and face significantly higher costs than the regular person. People with long-term physical health conditions (LTCs) such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases are more likely to experience mental health problems. The NHS costs associated with mental health in this segment of the population are between ?? billion and ??3 billion annually, thus representing a large welfare burden. People with comorbid physical and mental disorders are also less likely to be employed.1 Traditionally, delivery of primary care and mental health treatments has been separate, however, research suggests that integrating behavioral health with primary care and medical services is not only effective in reducing patient mental health symptoms, but is also associated with improved patient satisfaction with care, quality of life, and adherence to treatment.2 Integrated healthcare models have also been associated with reductions in healthcare costs3, and healthcare utilisation (e.g., significantly fewer emergency departments and office visits).4 Although the benefits of integrated care models for providers are less explored in literature, a recent study5 suggests that providers within these models experience an increased sense of support, reduced stress, and increased confidence in managing behavioral health conditions. Moreover, integrated behavioural health models can save providers' time; for example, a comparison between pediatric clinics with and without integrated behavioral health showed that pediatricians are more time-efficient during routine medical visits in the clinics with integrated behavioural health.6 Types of integrated behavioural healthcare There are different levels of integrated healthcare; for example, collaborative care models usually target mild to moderate mental health issues and refer to management of mental health issues within primary care contexts. Examples of collaborative care models are Improving Mood-Promoting Access to Collaborative Treatment7 in the US and Improving Access to Psychological Therapies8 in the UK. IAPT is an example of a stepped care model, where people with depression and anxiety within NHS are offered treatment either at Step 2 or Step 3 depending on their needs and symptom severity. At step 2, clients are recommended low-intensity CBT-based treatments such as guided self-help, internet-delivered CBT, or group CBT, while at step 3 they are recommended high-intensity CBT such as face-to-face interventions. Overall, integrated care models can increase access to care where there's limited specialised behavioral health services or other barriers to accessing traditional behavioral healthcare. They also have the potential to meet the needs of individuals struggling with co-morbid LTCs and mental health issues. A recent paper focused on evaluating a new Integrated-IAPT service developed by NHS England for individuals with LTCs that have co-morbid anxiety or depression9. This segment of population has generally been under-represented in IAPT due to physical and mental healthcare issues being managed separately. The authors evaluated the impact of this new service on 1,096 patients in three English counties between March 2017 and January 2018. Data was collected on secondary health care utilization costs (emergency department visits, outpatient, and inpatient admissions), depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), anxiety symptoms (GAD-7), and employment status (self-report). Overall, findings suggested that the Integrated-IAPT was effective in reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, that there was a decrease in health costs for the Integrated-IAPT sample compared to controls, and that unemployed patients who received Integrated-IAPT were more likely to find a job. It is noteworthy that the reduced secondary healthcare costs were mainly due to reduced inpatient and emergency room admissions, but not outpatient, and that this drop in secondary healthcare costs was steepest for individuals with cardiovascular comorbid problems. It's also interesting that most participants received face-to-face or telephone interventions, while only 3 individuals received it via telemedicine. Evidence-based internet-delivered CBT interventions (iCBT) such as SilverCloud Health's programmes for depression and anxiety have been proven to be effective in reducing symptoms, and cost-effective. iCBT has also been integrated with IAPT and has the potential to reach even more people in contexts such as Integrated-IAPT where more individuals with LTCs could be assisted in managing mental health symptoms. It could also further reduce healthcare costs and facilitate finding employment. The need for further evaluation and adaptation to real-world settings Despite the benefits of integrated care, adoption of these models has been slow, mainly due to implementation challenges in large health systems and difficulties with scaling small research trials models to real-world health systems.5 There is a need to systematically evaluate and improve integrated healthcare models as they expand to real-world settings and larger health systems. Integrated care models are not limited to collaborative care, they range from integrating behavioural health into primary care (e.g., for management of mild to moderate symptoms of depression, anxiety or substance abuse) to integrating primary care into behavioural health (e.g., incorporating primary health in centers for people with severe mental issues). A recent paper10 focused on four large-scale programmes in the US (Primary and Behavioural Health Care Integration, Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic, Medicaid Health Homes, and Patient-Centered Medical Home) that either incorporate primary health into behavioral health or are comprehensive, multi-targeted models. There is overall a lack of understanding of what the core elements of these programs are and how to successfully adapt these models to local contexts.10 The authors suggest these national programs have several core common features such as multidisciplinary teams, population health management, referral processes, sustainability strategies, ongoing care management, and coordination of care mechanisms. Authors explain that integrated care models can be shaped from bottom-up or top-down and that depending on the context/practice setting, different elements of integrated care may be prioritised; however, providers, payers, researchers, and policymakers can use these existing initiatives and the identified common features to understand, adapt, and advance comprehensive models of integrated care.10 The paper also identifies a few areas of improvement across these initiatives such as addressing social determinants of health and leveraging health IT. Leveraging existing technologies, including digital mental health platforms and other telehealth services can increase access to care, enhance the patient experience, and possibly reduce costs. Conclusion In the era of precision medicine where the goal is tailoring treatment so that each patient receives exactly the care, they need, integrating care for physical and mental health is essential. Not only can it remove barriers to accessing treatment and improve the overall health of individuals with LTCs and co-morbid mental health issues, but it can also lower overall costs associated with the treatment of these disorders and social welfare due to unemployment. SilverCloud Health will continue to be at the forefront of these efforts and leveraging iCBT has the potential to further enhance the positive findings from integrated care research studies. \n",

      "In 2017, one in nine children and young people (CYP) aged 5-19 had a probable mental health disorder. By 2020, this had risen to one in six, fuelled in part by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has placed huge burdens and impacts on children and young people's mental health. These impacts are not just felt by the children and young people but also by their families, who see their many pressures and uncertainties, especially as schools and colleges return after the summer holidays. Research showed that 67% of young people believed that the pandemic will have a long-term negative effect on their mental health. This is mirrored by the recent increase in NHS referrals for children and young people with conditions and symptoms that include anxiety, depression, eating disorders, self-harm and panic attacks. The demand for counselling for children is at an all-time high, with extra pressure being put on existing health and wellbeing services This has also created extra anxiety and stress for families and supporters who want to help their loved ones. The combination of underlying mental health challenges for children and young people coupled with the impact of the pandemic, led the Children's Commissioner to estimate that 1.3 million children experience mental health problems in the UK. With 300,000 young people gaining access to NHS services and 75% of young people with mental health problems saying they aren't getting the help they need, there is a clear gap in service provision that digital can help to fill. How SilverCloud is helping families Alongside the large range of world-leading mental health programmes aimed at adults, SilverCloud have developed three dedicated CYP programmes to support children and young people's mental health: Space from Anxiety (CYP) Supporting an Anxious Child Supporting an Anxious Teen Each programme has multiple, specially designed modules, packed full of interactive content with practical advice, exercises, and hints, and tips to support users and their families. These online programmes are based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) built, in conjunction with leading clinical experts, and focused solely on mental health in children and young people. They are developed in line with an update to the NICE guidelines on depression in children, which states that digital CBT is one of the most effective therapy methods in treating children and young people with mild depression. Available 24/7, the programmes allow users to access the materials at any time, from their own devices, how and when it suits them. They cover a wide range of topics, including: Self esteem Sleep difficulties Anger management Communication and relationships - including getting on with family members Negative thoughts Exam stress Being mindful/in the present Managing difficult emotions Planning for the future Friendships and social groups Getting active and eating better Unique to SilverCloud, our Supporting an Anxious Child and Supporting an Anxious Teen programmes are designed specifically to support parents and other carers so they can play an active role in helping their loved ones. They enable parents and carers to work through a number of modules that look at their own anxieties and also how to respond to children and young people who are anxious. This includes exercises that parents/caregivers can do with their child to help them manage their anxiety.The programmes also provide mental health professionals with all the resources they need to support parents/carers to work through with their children, or to work through themselves. They are designed so that they can be used in CAMHS and preventative mental health services and used alongside the programmes for parents. Offering both programmes together can increase the effectiveness for families, addressing the needs of parents and young people at the same time. Relevant and relatable content for children and young people The programmes allow users to make progress at their own pace, without having to wait until the next session, and help the children and young people learn techniques that they are then encouraged to build into their day-to-day lives. Like all SilverCloud programmes they can be accessed on-demand 24/7. The programmes are designed specifically to support children and young people's mental health, using personal stories and case studies to match the profiles of the user population, with sections addressing issues affecting them, such as exam stress. They don't talk down to children and young people but provide age-appropriate, relatable content in a straightforward tone and language. \n",

      "The systematic evaluation of outcome is becoming increasingly more routine in the provision of mental health and therapeutic services. Policy makers, third-party payers,government agencies, and consumers are concerned that limited health care dollars be spent on treatments that work. While therapists may feel singled out in this process, observers Most such efforts draw on well-established measures, both clinician and client rated, as well as observer ratings, physiological indices, and environmental information (Lambert,Ogles, & Masters, 1992). While these multidimensional assessments of outcome are valid and reliable, their methodological complexity, length of administration, and cost often render them infeasible for many service providers and settings. The average clinician's caseload is already overloaded with paperwork or other non-direct service-related activities(e.g., phone calls, team meetings, treatment planning, progress notes, and so on [Duncan& Miller, 2000]). Brown and colleagues (1999), for example, found that the majority of clinicians did not consider any measure or combination of measures that took more than5 minutes to complete, score, and interpret practical. As a result, a strong argument can be made for adopting measures that are brief in addition to being reliable and valid.  In addition to responding to funding source requirements and consumer demand,recent studies have explored how outcome evaluations can be used on an ongoing basis both to inform clinical decision making and enhance treatment effects. A growing body of research indicates, for example, that the client's subjective experience of change early in the treatment process is one of the better predictors of treatment outcome (Duncan & Miller,2000; Howard, Moras, Martinovich, & Lutz, 1996; Lambert & Bergin, 1994). In two studies, Lambert and colleagues (2001) and Whipple and colleagues (2003) found that incorporating outcome information into therapy resulted in a 65% improvement in the success of cases most at risk for a negative or null outcome. In another study of over 3,000 cases at a single agency, ongoing use of outcome information over 1 calendar year resulted in a150% improvement in overall effectiveness (Miller, Duncan, Brown, Sorrell, & Chalk, 2003). The present article describes the development and validation of an ultra-brief outcome measure, the Outcome Rating Scale (ORS; Miller & Duncan, 2000; see Appendix). The instrument's psychometric properties are examined and reported for both clinical and non-clinical samples. Based on experience with the instrument at the various sites in the study,the feasibility of the scale is considered. Results and implications for clinical practice and future research are discussed METHODS Development of the Outcome Rating Scale (ORS)The Outcome Rating Scale was developed as a brief alternative to the Outcome Questionnaire 45.2 (Lambert,Hansen, et al., 1996). The first two authors were familiar with the latter instrument, having used it in their own practices, as well as in research and consultation with numerous mental health agencies and a number of third-party payers. In virtually all instances, complaints regarding the length of time needed to complete the longer measure, as well as the size of the print, and content of the questions were quick to surface among clinicians and clients. Inspite of the availability of computerized and telephonic versions, as well as the possibility of intermittent rather than consistent use of the scale from session to session, problems with administration persisted. In busy clinics, for example, a single client showing up late could wreak havoc with the schedule. Use of the instrument in emerging telephonic and Internet based services was deemed impossible for similar reasons.  The specific items on the Outcome Rating Scale were adapted from the three areas of client functioning assessed by the OQ-45.2; specifically, individual, relational, and social. Changes in these three areas are widely considered to be valid indicators of successful treatment outcome(Kazdin, 1994; Lambert, Burlingame, et al., 1996; Lambert & Hill, 1994).  Research has demonstrated the reliability and validity of ultra-brief visual analog scales in several areas including: assessment and management of pain (see Ger, Ho, Sun, Wang, &Cleeland, 1999; Radbruch et al., 1999; Zalon, 1999); perceived quality of care (see Arneill &Devlin, 2002); psychoeducation (see Dannon, Iancu, & Grunhaus, 2002); health states preferences (Torrance, Feeny, & Furlong, 2001); and even the assessment of change in response to medical treatments (see Grunhaus, Dolberg, Polak, & Dannon, 2002). In addition to their brevity, ease of administration, and scoring, such scales frequently enjoy face validity with clients typically missing from longer and more technical measures that seem distant from the client's experience. With regard to the specific items on the Outcome Rating Scale, the three areas of client functioning were simply translated into visual analog format, with instructions to place hash mark on the corresponding 10 cm line, with low estimates to the left and high to the right.  Participants Participants in this study were recruited from one clinical and one non-clinical population. Nonclinical Group. The nonclinical group consisted of 86 participants made up of graduate masters-level students (n = 78), therapists and staff (n = 9) working at a community family service agency (CFS). 1Members of this group were either part-time or full-time residents from South Florida communities who ranged in age from 22 to 65, and were of mixed gender, socioeconomic, and ethnic backgrounds.  Clinical Group. Clinical data were collected from clients at the CFS (n = 435). CFS clients were enrolled in traditional office-based counseling and came to the agency presenting a typical range of initial difficulties.Among this sample were clients entering the program as employee assistance program (EAP) referrals. The CFS client sample was limited to adults aged 18 and above who had received a minimum of three clinical sessions and a maximum of 10 clinical sessions. This parameter was based on previous studies indicating that change in therapy is likely to occur after the completion of three sessions, with diminishing rates of change beyond 10 (Brown et al., 1999; Howard et al., 1986). Clients from the agency's substance abuse recovery program were excluded. Since substance abuse clients, in general,were mandated, outcome measurements might reflect concerns other than actual progress in counseling (e.g., referral issues) (see Lambert, Burlingame, et al., 1996).  Measures The Outcome Questionnaire 45.2. The OQ-45.2 is a 45-item self-report scale designed for repeated measurement of client functioning through the course of therapy and at termination. The measure has high internal consistency (.93) and test-retest reliability (.84).Moderate to high validity coefficients have been reported between the scale and other wellestablished measures of depression, anxiety, and global adjustment, for example, the SCL-90-R, Zung Depression and Anxiety Scales, Beck Depression Inventory, and Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (Lambert, Hansen, et al., 1996). Factor analysis of the OQ-45.2 failed to support construct validity for the three subscales (individual, interpersonal, and social role functioning). The research indicates that most of the variance can be accounted for on a single dimension: distress (Mueller, Lambert, & Burlingame, 1998). With increasing frequency, the OQ-45.2 is being used in psychotherapy outcome research. The instrument has proven particularly useful in documenting the effect of interventions due to therapy as it has been shown to be sensitive to change in a treated population while remaining stable in a nontreated population (Lambert, Burlingame, et al.,1996). Two studies have further documented the scale's ability to identify and improve thechances of success in cases at risk for a negative or null outcome (Lambert et al., 2001;Whipple et al., 2003). Procedure Nonclinical Group. Participants in the nonclinical group received four concurrent administrations of the Outcome Rating Scale and OQ -45.2 measures over a period ranging from 10 days to 5weeks. Six graduate students in the sample were tested in a classroom setting, with a proctor administering the instruments. They were retested 1 to 3 weeks following the initial testing period for an additional three to four concurrent tests. One subject student completed only the first administration and therefore was excluded from the analysis. Therapist and staff participants completed the Outcome Rating Scale and OQ -45.2 either at home or in their offices. The fourtest-retest administrations were separated by 1 day to 2 weeks. Clinical Group. At the CFS, therapists or the staff receptionist collected Outcome Rating Scale data from the clinical sample. The measure was introduced as a means of determining and improving therapy outcome. Administration of the Outcome Rating Scale was part of standard agency policy. Only first and last (pre- and post-) Outcome Rating Scale test scores were entered into the agency database. Pre- and post-ORS data were collected for those cases closed from February 2002 through February 2003. Cases where either an initial or final Outcome Rating Scale score was missing were excluded from the sample. A total sample of 435 adults between the ages of 18 and 83 were available for analysis. RESULTS Normative Data Table 1 displays the means and standard deviations for the nonclinical and clinical samples.As expected, a two-tailed t-test comparing initial Outcome Rating Scale scores for the nonclinical and clinical samples was highly significant (p < .00001). For the nonclinical sample, the mean OQ-45.2 score was comparable to that reported in the test manual for the large community normative sample of the measure (Lambert, Hansen,et al., 1996). This lends support to the premise that the nonclinical sample in this study,though relatively small, was similar. As in the case of the normative sample reported for the OQ-45.2 (Lambert, Burlingame, et al., 1996), age and sex differences in scores in the nonclinical sample proved to be non significant. For this reason, sex and age specific norms are not broken out here Reliability of the Outcome Rating Scale Both test-retest and internal consistency reliability were evaluated using the nonclinical sample (N = 86). Cronbach's coefficient alpha was calculated as the estimate of internal consistency. Coefficient alpha ranged from .87 at the first administration to .96 at the third and fourth administration. Coefficient alpha for all administrations (N = 336) was .93. Coefficient alpha (.93) for the Outcome Rating Scale compared favorably with that reported for the OQ-45.2. As a rule, one would expect a measure with only four items to have a lower reliability than a measure consisting of 45 items. This high degree of internal consistency reflects the fact that the four items correlate quite highly with one another, indicating that the measure perhaps can best be thought of as a global measure of distress rather than one possessing subscales for separate dimensions.  An estimate of test-retest reliability was obtained by correlating the test scores at the first administration with those at each subsequent administration. Table 3 presents the test-retest correlations for the Outcome Rating Scale and OQ-45. As would be expected from an ultra-brief measure,the rest-retest reliability was significantly lower than the OQ-45. However, interpretation oftest-retest reliability in a measure meant to be sensitive to change can be difficult. For example, the lower correlations could be due to the measure being more sensitive to small changes in the individual's global sense of well-being.  Validity of the Outcome Rating Scale Concurrent Validity. Concurrent validity was computed using Pearson product-moment correlations (Cohen & Cohen, 1983) between the Outcome Rating Scale total score and OQ-45.2 total score,as well as subscale scores on the nonclinical sample. Table 4 displays the correlation coefficients at each administration. In order to explore the relationship between Outcome Rating Scale items andOQ-45.2 subscales, the data from all four administrations were combined to create a sample of 335 paired administrations for the 86 subjects. Table 5 displays the correlation coefficients between the items of the Outcome Rating Scale and the subscales of the OQ-45.2, as well as the correlations with the total scores.  An inspection of Table 5 reveals a consistent pattern of moderately strong correlations between the Outcome Rating Scale items and the OQ-45.2 subscales, as well as total scores. However, there is little evidence that specific items correlate significantly more with specific subscales on theOQ-45. In all cases, the individual items on the Outcome Rating Scale correlated more highly with the OQ-45.2total score than any of the OQ-45.2 subscales.  The overall correlation between the Outcome Rating Scale and OQ-45.2 total scores is .59?? moderate indication of concurrent validity. Here again, the ultra-brief nature of the Outcome Rating Scale and the novel analog scoring method may be responsible. Indeed, though modeled on the OQ, it is not reasonable to expect very high coefficients of correlation between the two measures given the shorter nature of the Outcome Rating Scale. Nonetheless, the correlation is respectable and does provide evidence that the Outcome Rating Scale is an ultra-brief alternative for assessing global subjective distress similar to that measured by the full-scale score on the OQ-45.2.  Sensitivity to Change. If valid, the Outcome Rating Scale should reflect change following psychotherapy interventions, but remain stable in an untreated population (Lambert & Bergin, 1994).Therefore, it was expected that Outcome Rating Scale scores in the clinical sample would increase while those in the nonclinical sample would vary only minimally from a pre- and post test. Such a finding would provide some evidence of construct validity for the instrument.CFS clinical sample post test data were gathered at session 10. For purposes of comparison, change scores were calculated for the 77 individuals in the nonclinical sample that had a total of four administrations of the Outcome Rating Scale. Change was determined by comparing the total score at first administration to that of the final administration.  A t-test for correlated samples tested the hypothesis that Outcome Rating Scale scores would increase following therapy intervention. As expected, the t-test between the mean of the client pretest total scores and their post test total scores revealed statistically significant improvement.Conversely, a t-test between mean pre- and post-ORS test scores from the nonclinical sample proved non significant. Therefore, the Outcome Rating Scale was sensitive to change in those clients receiving psychotherapy intervention and relatively stable for those not receiving intervention.  Feasibility of the Outcome Rating Scale Feasibility of an outcome instrument involves the likelihood that the instrument, in fact, will be used. In clinical settings, feasibility is the degree to which an instrument can be explained,completed, and interpreted quickly and easily. If outcome measures do not meet the time demands of actual clinical practice, they may be met with resistance by staff and clients alike.In addition, measures that are difficult to score or appear irrelevant to clients and therapists are less likely to be used. Examining compliance rates over time in clinical sites with similar clients and mandate scan be used to assess the feasibility of the Outcome Rating Scale. Table 7 shows that at CFS, a compliance rate of 86% was achieved at the end of one year. Implementation of the OQ-45.2 in a similar outpatient setting had markedly different results. Utilization data were obtained from Family Therapy Associates (FTA) at Nova Southeastern University from June 1998 to June 1999.During that time period, a pilot study examining the effectiveness of incorporating client feedback in therapy was conducted using the OQ-45.2. FTA is a community mental health agency very similar in nature and scope to CFS. While FTA therapists were not mandated to utilize the outcome instrument, they were part of an ongoing research team and compliance was expected. Therapists were masters and doctoral students with close supervision and support provided throughout the research project. In spite of ongoing training and encouragement, however, use of the OQ dropped at 6 months and finished the year at 25%. DISCUSSION This article reports on the development of an ultra-brief outcome scale. The Outcome Rating Scale was designed for use by clinicians to assess change in clients following psychological intervention. Although a short measure cannot be expected to achieve the same precision or depth of information as a longer measure like the OQ-45.2, this study found that the Outcome Rating Scale has adequate validity, solid reliability, and high feasibility. Using a nonclinical sample, results demonstrated that the Outcome Rating Scale possesses moderate stability, as reflected by the test-retest coefficients. Future research should focus on the stability of the Outcome Rating Scale with clinical samples prior to clients undergoing therapy and over longer periods of time with normal controls. The internal consistency for the nonclinical sample was very high for the overall Outcome Rating Scale, as well as for the subscale scores. The high intercorrelations among the subscale scores suggest a single underlying factor, not unlike the single underlying factor of distress associated with the OQ-45.2. The nonclinical sample also was used to assess the validity of the Outcome Rating Scale. Although not as strong as hoped, the overall correlation with the OQ demonstrated that the Outcome Rating Scale is moderately related to this gold standard of self-report scales. Given that 45 items were reduced to four, a .59 indicator of concurrent validity meets expectations. However, a larger and more diverse nonclinical example may have yielded a higher correlation.  Lower Outcome Rating Scale scores were anticipated for the clinical sample at first administration. The difference found in the study suggests that the Outcome Rating Scale measures what it purports to: psychological distress. Changes in client scores between pre and posttest as compared to the stable scores for the nonclinical sample provide preliminary evidence of construct validity for the Outcome Rating Scale. It is curious that females scored significantly lower than males in the clinical sample.No explanation for this difference can be offered at present. Ongoing research is currently examining the issue in greater depth. Gains in feasibility appear to offset losses in reliability and validity when switching to a shorter measure like the Outcome Rating Scale. Higher compliance rates were observed for the Outcome Rating Scale in comparison with the OQ. Other anecdotal information collected by the first two authors support these results (i.e., everyday clinicians are far more inclined to use the Outcome Rating Scale than the OQ). One issue that appears to be strongly related to compliance is clinicians' perception of the usefulness of the measure to the therapeutic process. Many therapists see outcome measurement as an encumbrance to the process and an obstacle to forming alliances with clients.In consultation with a number of mental health agencies and third-party payers, the authors have repeatedly heard counselors report that outcome measurement is an ??dd-on??separate from actual clinical work and relevant only to management and other overseers. In such settings, measures that are easy to integrate into treatment and that have face validity encourage a partnership between the client and therapist for monitoring the effectiveness of services. Accountability becomes a joint endeavor, integral to alliance building, rather than simply more paperwork. Obviously, no matter how reliable and valid the measure, if it is not used,the benefits of outcome management will not be realized, and the benefits are considerable as evidenced by recent studies demonstrating as much as a 150% improvement in clinical outcomes (Miller et al., 2003.).All the problems typically associated with brief self-report tests (Boulet & Boss, 1991)apply to the Outcome Rating Scale; for example, interpretation relies on clients' accurate assessment of their levels of distress and there are no controls for response sets like social desirability. Additionally, the Outcome Rating Scale does not measure nor is intended to identify clinical risk factors such as suicide or alcohol or drug use. Future research with more diverse clinical and nonclinical samples is underway and should further identify the strengths and weakness of the measure. NOTE 1.
